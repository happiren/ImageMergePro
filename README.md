# ImageMergePro
Hapi Batch Image Merge Pro is designed to generate stitched images in batches. Each time the tool performs image stitching, it extracts images one by one from the folders configured in the configuration interface and stitches them into a single image (without re-using images). Then, it optionally overlays custom text and saves the result in the specified output folder.
